# EGNN MD trajectories
This is the repository for the work that the SURF HPML team has performed on applying Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (EGNNs) to the [MD trajectories dataset of small molecules](http://quantum-machine.org/datasets/). 

## Initialization
Codes are meant to be run on `Lisa`. Running `init.sh create` will create the virtual environments for you. Training scripts for the individual molecules can be found in the `Job scripts` folder.
